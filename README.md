# EarthNow
World today is facing a climate emergency where it needs to remove 59 gigatons of CO2e emissions and meet 1.5 °C target. Currently the solutions or focus is towards removing production side carbon emissions. This includes focus on removing energy harnessed from fossil fuels, etc. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) highlights the considerable influence of behavior, lifestyles and culture, including consumption patterns and dietary changes, on emissions (IPCC 2014a). However, much hasn’t been done to focus on demand-side actions to shift towards low-carbon lifestyle due to following problems:
•	Lack of awareness among Individual or consumer or households (ICH) to take carbon positive demand side decisions 
•	Unavailability of Incentive to reduce/remove switching cost, greenhouse premium
•	Inability to create co-ordination at a mass and global scale 
Individual or consumer or households (ICH) users have the potential to reduce/mitigate more than 30-35% of the global emissions across various categories such as Transport, Energy, Food and Nature. While this is not just good for the climate, these actions also have the potential to accelerate to low-carbon economy. Climate Demand side actions that reduce carbon emissions can unlock massive economic opportunities: 
•	Ability to price carbon across many categories 
•	Using transparent marketplace as a key lever to accelerate growth for low-carbon economy 
•	Creation of strong economic incentives for climate campaigns 
Clime DAO will build and capacitate (provide purpose, enable action and provide incentivization) a decentralized community of Individual or consumer or households (ICH) users to reduce their carbon footprint. 
In the short term, Clime DAO will focus on building the supply and demand side of the carbon economy but the long-term vision is to launch and support projects/campaigns that can provide significant reduction/mitigation of CO2e. 
Clime DAO allows web3builder, Individual or consumer or households (ICH) users, environmentalists to participate in Carbon footprint reduction through CLIM token (NFT- ERC 721) and CLI token (ERC20). 

CLIM token
Non-Fungible: per the ERC721 token standard
Backed by: Art that holds the promise of tomorrow (Digital Art/Video/music reels/etc) 
Use: The token can be bought by ICH who is looking for deeper purpose to push demand side action. Once bought, the ownership will be set to 100% only when the 2030 target of 2 carbon tonne is met. Once 100% ownership is granted, it can be traded on NFT marketplaces thereby rewarding and incentivizing ICH further. 

CLI tokens (matured CLI (mCLI) or unmatured CLI(uCLI))
Fungible: per the ERC20 token standard
Backed by: at least 1 tonne of matured or unmatured verified carbon emissions reduced/mitigated
Use: 
•	mCLI: Minted once 1 carbon tonne of carbon emissions are reduced/mitigated and verified. The token is transferred to ICH responsible for reducing the 1 carbon tonne. ICH can further stake their token and take part in Clime DAO governance. The governance includes voting on projects (climate activism and finance) and DAO policy. The mCLI token can further be sold to individuals/companies willing to buy carbon offsets from the market. 

•	uCLI: These non-transferrable credit tokens can be bought on the premise that equivalent carbon tonne will be reduced/mitigated in the future. This serves as a financial incentive for the ICH reduce/subsidize their green premium cost or can serve as insurance to cover any switching risk related to demand side actions.  Once the carbon emission has been reduced/mitigated these credit tokens will be burned and will be converted to mCLI. The newly minted mCLI token will be transferred to Credit Issuer of uCLI token. The ICH in this case will not be owner of the mCLI token. These credit token can range from discounts offered by companies to choose their sustainable product (5) or endorsements that allow sustainable replacement. There is ample room to innovate on how these credit tokens can be offered to ICH to move towards low carbon lifestyle. 

The short-term role of Clime DAO is to provide a decentralized, transparent and fair platform for ICH to contribute their efforts towards climate change and gets rewarded for the same. The larger vision of the DOA is to create economy around CLI tokens (mCLI and uCLI) and create marketplaces to reward and compensate for ICH’s effort in reducing their carbon footprint.  The spirit of Clime DAO is to be open and transparent and we request contributions from ICH users, environmentalists, developers, advisors, endorsers and many more.


CLIME DAO MANIFESTO 
Clime DAO aims to build and capacitate (provide purpose, enable action and provide incentivization) this decentralized community of Individual or consumer or households (ICH) users to reduce their carbon footprint. These reduction in carbon footprint can be further used for climate activism or financing specific initiatives. 
Clime DAO is a collective of environmentalists/advisors, developers, endorsers that ICH users can leverage to drive change in the climate emergency, today.
Clime DAO believes this movement by ICH community to reduce their carbon footprint will yield data patterns, consumer choices, future trends and much more. Clime DAO will fuel the low carbon movement by creating a platform that provides ample room for innovation on marketplace products thereby shaping the low carbon economy of tomorrow. 
Climate change is an emergency NOW which needs response and urgent action from everyone across the globe. 

Clime DAO Vision
Clime DAO will act like a medium for carbon footprint reduction at an individual, consumer or household level. It will use Web3 to create purpose, enable action and incentivize carbon footprint reduction. Clime DAO will consider itself successful if it can in any way bring down the average CO2 of 4 tonnes per person thereby contributing to meet the 1.5 °C target. 

Clime DAO's approach will enable us to build a low carbon movement that can reduce the average carbon footprint per person and execute large scale sustainability initiatives/ask/demands, create a sense of urgency to act now, and aggregate community of climate experts to accelerate contribution. 
Clime DAO ask of Blockchain 
To meet the vision, we need immediate and sustained emission reduction. This is a movement that needs to be coordinated at a global scale (barring the geographical boundaries, race, or color) rather than waiting for the governance policies or subsidies. 
Web3 can enable this:
•	NFT enable unique ownership of asset/collectible
•	DeFi delivers a step change in the way we collectively pool our capital to deliver impact.
•	Smart contracts disintermediate, facilitate and automate, and enable novel reward systems.
•	Web3 technologies enable coordination, collaboration and innovation, with transparency and accountability.
•	Open source software and composability enable rapid scaling of this vision.
Blockchain technology has the potential to drive action by creating trust, transparency and creating networks that knows no boundaries. Blockchain has the ability to motivate human race for purpose and goal that is shared and needs collective actions. It removes the ability for dependence on external stimulus and gives this planet a chance to meet the defined targets and keep the human race alive! (does it sounds like star trek or Apocalypse? Where we are today, the resemblance between fiction vs realty is strikingly close and all it takes is the human mind to realize it.)
